description: "School project where we had to design a car insurance management interface, using PHP."
---

As part of my last year in preparatory school at CY-Tech, my classmates and I had to create a website using [PHP](https://www.php.net/).

The website had to be a proof of concept for a car insurance management interface. Thus, we needed to provide functionality like :

- Contract management
- Live chat system
- Incident declaration
- Issues management
- User management

All of that was implemented in PHP for the back-end and Bootstrap and native JavaScript for the front-end.
