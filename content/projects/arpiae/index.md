ARPIÆ is the Junior-Enterprise of the CY-Tech campus in Pau. Its goal is to provide student with the opportunity to earn money and experience through mission from third party companies.

As a member of this association, I and another student were tasked with redesigning the website.

Using native JavaScript and the Tailwind CSS framework, we built it around a minimalist and simple design.
