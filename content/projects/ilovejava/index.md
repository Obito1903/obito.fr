As part of my third semester in computer science at CY-Tech university, my classmates and I had to create a website using concept and technologies studied during this semester.

This website had to be built using the [Spring](https://spring.io/) framework for Java. We also had to use the MVC (Model View Controller) and DAO (Data Access Object) pattern extensively, in order to keep a structured codebase, and allow for easy expandability.

With two other classmates, we decided to build a small forum inspired by platform like [stackexchange](https://stackexchange.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).

This forum would be solely focused on the Java programming language, and other subject related to it.

## Features
