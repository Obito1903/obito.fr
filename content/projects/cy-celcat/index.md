description: "A small program to fetch Celcat calendars and save it to an ICS or PNG file for the CY-tech university."

**CY-Celcat** is a project initially created to address a problem with the CY-Tech agenda provider.

While the agenda is available online through the university website, this agenda is cumbersome to access and can't be integrated to tools and apps like Google Agenda or IOS iCalendar.

To allow for easy integration with such tools, I created a small program that scrap the agenda from the university website and convert it to an ICS file that can easily be imported to Google Agenda or other similar service.

Since the beginning, the project as grown and now provide HTML and PNG renders of the calendars for users who simply want to see their agenda without going through a dedicated app.

It also supports multiple agendas and users.
