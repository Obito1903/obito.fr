I am passionate about a variety of subject revolving mainly around computer science and new technologies, such as embed systems, cloud computing, web development, hardware design, operating system&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Use UUID in SQLite database with Rust + Diesel.rs</title><link>https://obito.fr/posts/2022/12/use-uuid-in-sqlite-database-with-rust-diesel.rs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 19:05:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/posts/2022/12/use-uuid-in-sqlite-database-with-rust-diesel.rs/</guid><description>Recently in one of my project I ran into a problem where I wanted to use UUIDs in my database but as it turns out SQLite only support 5 data types : TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, NUMERIC and BLOB. This in itself is not really a concern, as I use an ORM (Object-relational mapping) called diesel.rs in my project.
The issue that I encountered is in the ORM itself. The crate diesel.</description></item><item><title>ARPIÆ</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/arpiae/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 13:51:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/arpiae/</guid><description>ARPIÆ is the Junior-Enterprise of the CY-Tech campus in Pau. Its goal is to provide student with the opportunity to earn money and experience through mission from third party companies.
As a member of this association, I and another student were tasked with redesigning the website.
Using native JavaScript and the Tailwind CSS framework, we built it around a minimalist and simple design.</description></item><item><title>Ilovejava</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/ilovejava/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 13:51:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/ilovejava/</guid><description>As part of my third semester in computer science at CY-Tech university, my classmates and I had to create a website using concept and technologies studied during this semester.
This website had to be built using the Spring framework for Java. We also had to use the MVC (Model View Controller) and DAO (Data Access Object) pattern extensively, in order to keep a structured codebase, and allow for easy expandability.</description></item><item><title>Java Eigenface</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/java-eigenfaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 14:05:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/java-eigenfaces/</guid><description>At the end of my first year in computer science at CY-Tech, my classmates and I were given a project consisting of implementing the Eigenface algorithm in Java. A programming language that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned through the year.
Eigenface is one of the most basic algorithm used in facial recognition. It is pretty straightforward to implement once understood. But its simplicity come at the cost of precision.
The Algorithm The Eigenface algorithm is based on a technique known as &amp;ldquo;Principal component analysis&amp;rdquo;, or PCA for short.</description></item><item><title>Paulorado.fr</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/paulorado/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 14:05:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/paulorado/</guid><description>Each year at CY-Tech university a new Student Office is elected. As part of the campaign for Student Office each side need to build a website.
As a member of the Paulorado office, I and 2 other students where tasked with building the website.
It needed to show a list of all the memeber of the office, display practical information about what activities we planned to do and contain a mini-game.</description></item><item><title>Rusty Hass Laptop</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/rusty-hass-laptop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 14:05:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/rusty-hass-laptop/</guid><description>RHL or Rusty-Hass-Laptop is a small program that can be run as a user service in systemd to send usage and energy statistics about your laptop to a Home-assistant instance.
Currently, only battery level, CPU Frequency, cores and kernel version are reported to home-assistant.</description></item><item><title>Control your HI-FI setup with Home-assistant and an IR-ESP01</title><link>https://obito.fr/posts/2022/01/control-your-hi-fi-setup-with-home-assistant-and-an-ir-esp01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 17:13:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/posts/2022/01/control-your-hi-fi-setup-with-home-assistant-and-an-ir-esp01/</guid><description>I recently bought a new integrated amplifier for my hi-fi setup to replace my old malfunctioning one. I mainly chose this one because I had a good deal on it, but it also came with a IR-remote to control it (not that impressive I know). And so naturally I wanted to automate it and add it with my IoT network which is controlled by Home-Assistant, an open-source home automation tool.</description></item><item><title>Repair GRUB after a messy Windows 11 upgrade</title><link>https://obito.fr/posts/2021/12/repair-grub-after-a-messy-windows-11-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 20:16:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/posts/2021/12/repair-grub-after-a-messy-windows-11-upgrade/</guid><description>So you have a dual boot with Windows 10 and you decided to upgrade to Windows 11 to enjoy all of its new WSL functionalities or try the WSA. Everything goes fine in the first time, you do everything necessary to please the Windows 11 system requirement checker, and you start the upgrade.

The website had to be a proof of concept for a car insurance management interface. Thus, we needed to provide functionality like :
Contract management Live chat system Incident declaration Issues management User management All of that was implemented in PHP for the back-end and Bootstrap and native JavaScript for the front-end.</description></item></channel></rss>
