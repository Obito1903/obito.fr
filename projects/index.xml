This website had to be built using the Spring framework for Java. We also had to use the MVC (Model View Controller) and DAO (Data Access Object) pattern extensively, in order to keep a structured codebase, and allow for easy expandability.</description></item><item><title>Java Eigenface</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/java-eigenfaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 14:05:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/java-eigenfaces/</guid><description>At the end of my first year in computer science at CY-Tech, my classmates and I were given a project consisting of implementing the Eigenface algorithm in Java. A programming language that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned through the year.
Eigenface is one of the most basic algorithm used in facial recognition. It is pretty straightforward to implement once you understand it. But its simplicity come at the cost of precision.
The Algorithm The Eigenface algorithm is based on a technique known as &amp;ldquo;Principal component analysis&amp;rdquo;, or PCA for short.</description></item></channel></rss>
