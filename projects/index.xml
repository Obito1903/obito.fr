Its goal is to provide student with the opportunity to earn money and experience through mission from third party companies.
As a member of this association, I and another student were tasked with redesigning the website.
Using native JavaScript and the Tailwind CSS framework, we built it around a minimalist and pure design.</description></item><item><title>Ilovejava</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/ilovejava/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 13:51:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/ilovejava/</guid><description>As part of my third semester in computer science at CY-Tech university, my classmates and I had to create a website using concept and technologies studied during this semester.
This website had to be built using the Spring framework for Java. We also had to use the MVC (Model View Controller) and DAO (Data Access Object) pattern extensively, in order to keep a structured codebase, and allow for easy expandability.</description></item><item><title>Java Eigenface</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/java-eigenfaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 14:05:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/java-eigenfaces/</guid><description>At the end of my first year in computer science at CY-Tech, my classmates and I were given a project consisting of implementing the Eigenface algorithm in Java. A programming language that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned through the year.
Eigenface is one of the most basic algorithm used in facial recognition. It is pretty straightforward to implement once you understand it. But its simplicity come at the cost of precision.
The Algorithm The Eigenface algorithm is based on a technique known as &amp;ldquo;Principal component analysis&amp;rdquo;, or PCA for short.</description></item><item><title>Paulorado.fr</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/paulorado/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 14:05:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/paulorado/</guid><description>Each year at CY-Tech university a new Student Office is elected. As part of the campaign for Student Office each side need to build a website.
As a memeber of the Paulorado office, I and 2 other students where tasked with building the website.
It needed to show a listt of all the memeber of the office, display practical information about what activities we planned to do and contain a minigame.</description></item><item><title>Rusty Hass Laptop</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/rusty-hass-laptop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 14:05:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/rusty-hass-laptop/</guid><description>RHL or Rusty-Hass-Laptop is a small program that can be run as a user service in systemd to send usage and energy statistics about your laptop to a Home-assistant instance.
Currently, only battery level, CPU Frequency, cores and kernel version are reported to home-assistant.</description></item><item><title>Car-A-Ok</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/car-a-ok/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 13:51:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/car-a-ok/</guid><description>As part of my last year in preparatory school at CY-Tech, my classmates and I had to create a website using PHP.
The web site had to be an proof of concept for a car insurance managment interface. Thus we needed to provide functionality like :
Contract management Live chat system Incident declaration Issues management User management All of that was implemented in PHP for the back-end and Bootstrap and native JavaScript for the front-end.</description></item><item><title>CY-Celcat</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/cy-celcat/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 14:05:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/cy-celcat/</guid><description>CY-Celcat is a project initially created to address a problem with the CY-Tech agenda provider.
While the agenda is available online through the university website, this agenda is cumbersome to access and can&amp;rsquo;t be integrated to tools and apps like Google Agenda or IOS iCalendar.
To allow for easy integration with such tools, I created a small program that scrap the agenda from the university website and convert it to an ICS file that can easily be imported to Google Agenda or other similar service.</description></item><item><title>Free Real Estate</title><link>https://obito.fr/projects/free-real-estate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 13:51:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://obito.fr/projects/free-real-estate/</guid><description>FRE or Free Real Estate, is a set of utilities and services put together in order to provide a fully featured development environment, for web projects inside a web browser.
It is meant to be used for web development classes and project at CY-Tech university.
FRE provide an isolated Web IDE to each user by using the code-server project.
Files in each instance are accessible through a web file manager called filebrowser</description></item></channel></rss>
